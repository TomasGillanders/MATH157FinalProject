# MATH 157 - Final Project
## Overview of AES - Symmetric Cryptography

This project was completed as part of the continuous assessment requirement for the MATH 157, "Introduction to Mathematical Computing", 
course taken while attending University of California, San Diego as a participant of the University of California Education Abroad
Program (UCEAP Reciprocity) for the Winter and Spring Quarters of 2023.

The project outlines the mathematical foundation, implementation and the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard, a symmetric-key algorithm.
The material is presented in the form of a lecture that was presented to a group of peers, together with a set of homework problems and 
solutions; posed as to test and further ones understanding of the material presented.

The code presented in this project was written using the Julia Programming Language, which was the language utilized throughout the course, and
the presentation was produced in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

The presentation of the material covered by this project was assessed on the basis of Presentation, Topic Coverage, the Exercises and Solutions,
and on the quality of the feedback that was received.  Full marks were awarded for each of these elements.
