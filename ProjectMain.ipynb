    "### §0.1 Symmetric Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of *Symmetric Cryptography* is simpler to that of *Asymmetric Cryptography*, as was discussed in class. With Symmetric Cryptography, the same *key* is used in both the encryption and decryption processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have two people, Alice and Bob, who want to exchange messages without a third-party, Eve say, being able to read what they are sending.  Alice and Bob decide that they want to use a *symmetric* crytographic system to encode/encrypt their messages, so that the only thing Eve can see is their scrambled data.  To do this, Alice and Bob decide on a *key* that they can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages.  They can then send messages to each other with ease, knowing that their secrets are safe, as long as their mutual key is kept secret from everbody else.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Symmetric Encryption](./Images/SymmetricEncryption.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of *Symmetric Cryptography* has many advantages:\n",
    "- The production of strong keys is generally computionally less expensive, when compared to keys used in asymmetric cryptography.\n",
    "- The size of the keys used is generally much smaller than keys used in asymmetric crytography, while providing comparable levels of protection.\n",
    "- The algorithms implemented are generally computationally inexpensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are also some significant drawbacks with using a Symmetric Cryptosystem:\n",
    "- If a third-party (Eve) were to find out the secret key, it would allow them to both decrypt messages and also encrypt new messages and insert them into Alice and Bob's conversation; neither of whom would know that the message was not sent by the other.\n",
    "- How Alice and Bob share their key initially is also problematic.  If they cannot meet in person (as is the case in reality), then they must rely on a different secret key to protect the privacy of the key that they are trying to share.  However, this means that they must have the other secret key in the first place, and how was that key shared?  This can lead to a never-ending dependency on a different key.\n",

    "\n",
    "NIST opened the development of candidate symmetric ciphers to independent parties, who's algorithms were then compared and scrutinized publically in order to determine who's algorithm provided the best balance between security, efficiency and the ability to be implemented over different platforms; ranging from 8-bit processors to servers and work-stations.\n",

    "As discussed in §1.3 (Operations on Finite Fields & Polynomial Representations) of the lecture, \"multiplication\" in $GF(p^n)$ must be defined diferently to the familiar operation of multiplication on the real number field that we use every day, so that it satisfies the field axioms (as specified in §1.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the implementation of `MixColumns` above, the function `mul` was used when multiplying elements of $GF(2^8)$.  This function was defined in the 'AESTables.jl' file but here we explore how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication in $GF(2^8)$ can be carried out using a modified version of the \"Peasants Algorithm\" for multiplicaiton (see this [Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/HJ_PP5rqLg0) starring Johnny Ball for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication algorithm is as follows (to computed $a \\otimes b$ in $GF(2^8)$):\n",
    "1. Initialise a variable `prod` (of type `UInt8`, i.e. stored in a byte of memory) that will updated throughout the multiplication process and result as the product of the numbers $a,b \\in GF(2^8)$.\n",
    "2. Writing `a` and `b` in binary representation, check if the rightmost bit (\"unit\" position) of `b` is a 1.  If it is add `a` to `prod`.\n",
    "3. Now check if the leftmost bit of `a` is a 1 and keep track of it using the variable `overflow`.\n",
    "4. Shift `a` one bit to the left and disregard the leftmost bit.  If the leftmost bit of `a` was found to be 1 in the previous step, then add $00011011_2$ to `a`.  Otherwise, do nothing.\n",
    "5. Shift `b` one bit to the right, disregarding the rightmost bit and setting the leftmost bit to 0.\n",
    "6. Repeat Steps 2-5 until `b = 00000000`. Return `prod`, the product of $a$ and $b$ in $GF(2^8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Explanation**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The above process works for the same reason that the \"Peasant's Algorithm\" for multiplication works.  Left bitshifts *in general* correspond to multiplication by 2 (with a caveat when the leftmost bit is 1) and right bitshifts correspond to integer division by 2 (or $10_2$).  Thus, by checking the rightmost bit of `b` on every iteration (while 'doubling' `a` at the same time), we are checking if the $2^n \\times a$ term should be added to `prod` (where $n$ correponds to the index of the $2^n$ term in the binary representation of $b$, starting at index zero from the right).  This is exactly what we do when performing long multiplication, except performed base 10.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The complication in the above algorithm arises when the leftmost bit of `a` is 1.  Since we are working over the field $GF(2^8)$, we cannot simply double a number greater than $2^7 \\equiv 10000000_2$ since it will no longer be in the allowed range. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Recall that in terms of the polynomial representation of $GF(2^8)$, \"doubling\" corresponds to simply multiplying our polynomial by $x$.  Thus, if $deg(a(x)) = 7$ then $deg(x \\bullet a(x)) = 8 \\nless 8$ and thus, the resulting polynomial must be reduced by the reduction polynomial.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The reduction of `a` (after the left bitshift) modulo our reduction polynomial ($m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$ from §1.4), corresponds to addition of `a` with $00011011_2$ (i.e. the bits correspond to the coefficients of $m(x)$ without the $x^8$ term*).  This works because if $a(x) = q(x) \\bullet m(x) + r(x)$, then $a(x) \\equiv r(x) \\pmod(m(x))$.  However, since we know $deg(a(x)) = 8$ (after bitshift), then $a(x) = 1 \\bullet m(x) + r(x) \\implies r(x) = a(x) - m(x)$.  Since the bitwise XOR is its own inverse in $GF(2^8)$, we then replace `a` with `a ⊻ 00011011`, its correct value in $GF(2^8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    ">\\* The bit correspinding to the $x^8$ term can be omitted, since the leftmost bit of `a` is disregarded after the left bitshift.  If both of these bits were not disregarded, it would make no difference, since they would still cancel each other out: 1 ⊻ 1 = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function, `mul`, that takes in two elements from $GF(2^8)$, in hexadecimel format, and computes their product (in $GF(2^8)$) using the above procedure and the bitwise operators provided by Julia. The explicite binary represetations should not be used in this function.\n",
